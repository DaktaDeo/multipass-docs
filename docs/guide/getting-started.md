# Getting Started 

Multipass is a new Bussiness Intelligence App with a Twist. üòâ

Multipass takes the pain and hassle out of managing a small bussiness and can even be used to manage you association. It does not matter if you want to [manage your own Team](/apps/humans/README.md), have [a full fledged Boat Price Calculator](/apps/sales/cpq.md), [organize a Soccer Tournament](/apps/tournaments/README.md) or just have a tool that handles [your CRM data with flexibility](/apps/contacts/README.md)- Multipass is the solution for you.

## Software Requirements
Multipass is a SaaS application. This means it runs in your favorite browser! No need to install or download updates and your data is always available where you have internet.

### Browser Support

Multipass should work in any web-kit based modern browser.

:::warning Limitations during the Beta period

Due to limited resources of our dev-team we recommend Vivaldi, Brave or Google Chrome. These are the browsers we use to develop/test the app and are therefore guaranteed to work best.

### Mobile Support
During the beta **our main focus is having a fully working app on desktop**. We do however ‚ù§ our iPhone, and hate not being able to access/add info on the road! üå≤

You can count on it that, **at the very least the most essential features things will work on an iphone SE 2020**. Like seeing contact info or calling them directly from the list. Sometimes with a bit of compromises like using landscape mode or manual clicking on 'hide' for the sidebar.

:::warning Limitations during the Beta period
Cutoff device is an 11-inch iPad pro 202 (M1); using Brave iOS. Used in Landscape mode. Basic feature set & usable with sometimes UI work-arounds.
