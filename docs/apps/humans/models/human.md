# Human
A Human is someone who is an active member of your team. Someone who you work with, internally. This can be someone who has an [Account](/reference/terms-and-definitions#account) or not.

Humans are different from [Persons](/apps/contacts/models/person), those are bound to a [Contacts](/apps/contacts/models/contact) and are used for external connections
