<p>I will use the term <code v-pre>Model</code> when talking <em>about piece that holds data</em>. That means that you can substitute the word for every node of data Multipass has in that context. be it a <code v-pre>Contact</code>, <code v-pre>Label</code>, 'Human', ..</p>
<p>Model is a programmatic term and somewhat synonymous with <code v-pre>object</code></p>

<p>A Human is someone who is an active member of your team. Someone who you work with, internally. This can be someone who has an <a href="#account">Account</a> or not.</p>

<p>Teams are <em>the</em> core of Multipass. Each Team has his own database inside Multipass. Everything is bound to a single Team. You can however below to several Teams, with different roles.</p>
<p>A Team usualy contains several Team Members, working together; but you can create your own personal Team.</p>
<p>A Team can be anything, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>a group of people working together on in a society</li>
<li>a small company</li>
<li>your personal team containing your own family data and relationships</li>
<li>and much much more</li>
