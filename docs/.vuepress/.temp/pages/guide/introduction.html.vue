<h2 id="browser-support" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#browser-support" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Browser Support</h2>
<p>Multipass should work in any web-kit based modern browser.</p>
<div class="custom-container warning"><p class="custom-container-title">Limitations during the Beta period</p>
<p>Due to limited resources of our dev-team we recommend Vivaldi, Brave or Google Chrome. These are the browsers we use to develop/test the app and are therefore guaranteed to work best.</p>

<h2 id="mobile-support" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#mobile-support" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Mobile Support</h2>
<p>During the beta <strong>our main focus is having a fully working app on desktop</strong>. We do however ‚ù§ our iPhone, and hate not being able to access/add info on the road! üå≤</p>
<p>You can count on it that, <strong>at the very least the most essential features things will work on an iphone SE 2020</strong>. Like seeing contact info or calling them directly from the list. Sometimes with a bit of compromises like using landscape mode or manual clicking on 'hide' for the sidebar.</p>
<div class="custom-container warning"><p class="custom-container-title">Limitations during the Beta period</p>
<p>Cutoff device is an 11-inch iPad pro 202 (M1); using Brave iOS. Used in Landscape mode. Basic feature set &amp; usable with sometimes UI work-arounds.</p>
