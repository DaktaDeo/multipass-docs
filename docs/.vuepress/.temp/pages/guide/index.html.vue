<p>Multipass is a SaaS application. It runs on our own private Cloud servers, hosted on Digital Ocean.</p>
<p>With 1 account you can access and create multiple Teams.</p>
<p>Each Team has its own separate database on our managed database cluster.</p>
<h2 id="billing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#billing" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Billing</h2>
<p>We use a usage-based, block based subscription. Each Team is billed according to usage, not the number of accounts that have access to it. The more data you consume, the higher your subscription will be.</p>
<p>This revenue model allows for a Team of 25 people to work together on a small set of data, keeping the costs low and the ROI high. While another Team of 1 with thousands of records paying their fair share. This is our view of a fair billing system.</p>
<p>The exact pricing is currently being tested during our closed beta period.</p>
