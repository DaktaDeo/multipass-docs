<p>During the beta <strong>our main focus is having a fully working app on desktop</strong>. We do however ‚ù§ our iPhone, and hate not being able to access/add info on the road! üå≤</p>
<p>You can count on it that, <strong>at the very least the most essential features things will work on an iphone SE 2020</strong>. Like seeing contact info or calling them directly from the list. Sometimes with a bit of compromises like using landscape mode or manual clicking on 'hide' for the sidebar.</p>
