# Models 
I will use the term `Model` when talking _about piece that holds data_. That means that you can substitute the word for every node of data Multipass has in that context. be it a `Contact`, `Label`, 'Human', ..

Model is a programmatic term and somewhat synonymous with `object`

## Contact
- see [Apps > Contacts](/apps/contacts/models.md#contact) 

## Human
A Human is someone who is an active member of your team. Someone who you work with, internally. This can be someone who has an [Account](#account) or not.

Humans are different from [Persons](#person), those are bound to a [Contacts](#contact) and are used for external connections

see
- [Apps > Humans](/apps/humans/README.md)
- [Apps > Contacts](/apps/contacts/README.md)

## Person
- see [Apps > Contacts](/apps/contacts/models.md#person)


## Team
Teams are _the_ core of Multipass. Each Team has his own database inside Multipass. Everything is bound to a single Team. You can however below to several Teams, with different roles.

A Team usualy contains several Team Members, working together; but you can create your own personal Team.

A Team can be anything, including:
- a group of people working together on in a society
- a small company
- your personal team containing your own family data and relationships
- and much much more
