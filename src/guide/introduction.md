## What is Multipass? {#what-is-multipass}

Multipass is a new Bussiness Intelligence App with a Twist. ðŸ˜‰ 

Multipass takes the pain and hassle out of managing a small bussiness and can even be used to manage you association.

With them you can manage a lot of things like: Clients, Suppliers, Employees, Invoices, Payments, Products, Assembled Products, Product Configurations, Tournaments, Matches, Teams,  etc. Call it masterdata.

[Boards](boards/introduction) is the visual tool to get things done like: tasks, workflow, lists, ect.

## How it works {#how-it-works}

Multipass is a SaaS application. 

### From a user perspective:
- With 1 account you can access and create multiple Teams
- You can change certain settings based on the Team, like the nickname, email, etc.
- Each Team has its own separate database
- Each Team has its own set of enabled Apps
- All Apps are available to all Teams
- Each Team has its own set of Users (= people who can log in to the Team)
- Each Team has its own settings, like profile image, language, etc.
- Each User has its own preferences, like language (wip), darkmode (wip), etc

### Technically:
- It runs on our own private Cloud servers, hosted on Digital Ocean
- We use a managed database (MySQL) cluster, also hosted on Digital Ocean
- Databases are backed up daily, on S3
- Media is uploaded to S3 buckets, also hosted on Digital Ocean
- All Media can be accessed via a CDN, also hosted on Digital Ocean
- We use a custom built API to communicate with the frontend
- The frontend is built with Vue.js, backend is built with Laravel
- We use Forge to manage our servers, Envoyer to deploy, and Laravel Horizon to manage our queues
- Search is powered by Algolia
- (all) Errors are captured, sent to Flare, and reported to our Slack channel
- Currently we use a custom uptime monitoring system, but we are looking into using a 3rd party service for this
- we use a bunch of [opensource](/about/opensource) packages


## How much does Multipass cost? {#how-much-does-Multipass-cost}
We use a usage-based, block based subscription. Each Team is billed according to usage, not the number of accounts that have access to it. The more data you consume, the higher your subscription will be.

This revenue model allows for a Team of 25 people to work together on a small set of data, keeping the costs low and the ROI high. While another Team of 1 with thousands of records paying their fair share. This is our view of a fair billing system.

The exact pricing is currently being tested during our closed beta period.
