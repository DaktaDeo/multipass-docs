## What is Multipass? {#what-is-multipass}

Multipass is a new Bussiness Intelligence App with a Twist. ðŸ˜‰ 

Multipass takes the pain and hassle out of managing a small bussiness and can even be used to manage you association. It does not matter if you want to manage your own Team, have a full fledged Boat Price Calculator, organize a Soccer Tournament or just have a tool that handles your CRM data with flexibility - Multipass is the solution for you.

After creating you Team you have instant access to all the available apps, including:

- [Calendar Events](/app/calendar-events)
- [Contacts](/app/contacts)
- [Media](/app/media)
- [Humans](/app/humans)
- [Products](/app/products)
- [Sales](/app/sales)
- [Tournaments](/app/tournaments)

With them you can manage a lot of things like: Clients, Suppliers, Employees, Invoices, Payments, Products, Assembled Products, Product Configurations, Tournaments, Matches, Teams,  etc.

You may already have questions - don't worry. We will cover every little detail in the rest of the documentation. For now, please read along so you can have a high-level understanding of what Multipass offers.

## How it works {#how-it-works}

Multipass is a SaaS application. It runs on our own private Cloud servers, hosted on Digital Ocean.

With 1 account you can access and create multiple Teams.

Each Team has its own separate database on our managed database cluster.

## How much does Multipass cost? {#how-much-does-Multipass-cost}
We use a usage-based, block based subscription. Each Team is billed according to usage, not the number of accounts that have access to it. The more data you consume, the higher your subscription will be.

This revenue model allows for a Team of 25 people to work together on a small set of data, keeping the costs low and the ROI high. While another Team of 1 with thousands of records paying their fair share. This is our view of a fair billing system.

The exact pricing is currently being tested during our closed beta period.
