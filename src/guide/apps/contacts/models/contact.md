# Contact
Every `Contact` has the ability to have multiple `Persons`. These act as the _details of a contact_. For business they can be the people that work there, for a family these are the family members, ...
If your person is an individual who is not bound to an organisation, you have two options:
- create the individual as a 'Contact' 
- create a 'Contact' that is a box to collect those persons, eg Individuals.

## Create a contact
Let's create your first contact: hit the red `Add button` on the right corner below and choose the Card icon. A dialogbox 'quick create contact' pops up. The minimum information required is:
- `Displayname`

A displayname can be 
- an organisation, eg Rode Kruis
- a shortcut for a long company name, eg Howest for Hogeschool West-Vlaanderen.
- a name of an individual, eg Paul Boone.

Click `SAVE` to return to the listview. Great job, you see your first contact.

## Ordening contacts
With `Contact Type` and `Labels` you organise your contacts. More about these concepts in the dictionary...
Remember: Labels are used across all apps, Contact types are descriptions only available for contacts.
