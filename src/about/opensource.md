# Open Source

This is a list of all the open source packages we use in our ecosystem. We are very grateful for the work of all the developers who have created these packages. We have tried to give credit where credit is due, but if we have missed something please let us know.


Multipass wouldn't be possible without these open-source software, packages and libraries.
We will pay it Forward by contributing to these projects as much as we can.
