Multipass' community is slowly growing and if you're reading this, there's a good chance you're ready to join it. So... welcome!

Now we'll answer both what the community can do for you and what you can do for the community.

## What You Can Do {#what-you-can-do}

### Help Fellow Users {#help-fellow-users}

Direct involvement in the project is not the only form of contribution to the Multiplass community. Answering a question for a fellow Multipass user on our [Github Discussions Forum](https://github.com/DaktaDeo/Multipass/discussions) is also considered a valuable contribution.

If you _are_ a core member, you can help tremendously by answering questions in the public repo and move them to the issues in the main one or discuss them on a meeting. 

The more people we have answering questions, the more time we can spend on improving Multipass and working on the right things.

### Help Triage Issues {#help-triage-issues}

Triaging an issue means gathering missing information, running the reproduction, verifying the issue's validity, and investigating the cause of the issue.

We will receive many issues in [our public repository on GitHub](https://github.com/DaktaDeo/Multipass). Our bandwidth is limited compared to the amount of users we have, so issue triaging alone can take an enormous amount of effort from the team. By helping us triage the issues, you are helping us become more efficient, allowing us to spend time on higher priority work.

You don't have to triage an issue with the goal of fixing it (although that would be nice too). Sharing the result of your investigation, for example the commit that led to the bug, can already save us a ton of time.

If you _are_ a core member, you can help tremendously by answering questions in the public repo and move them to the main one. The more people we have answering questions, the more time we can spend on improving Multipass and working on the right things.

### Share (and Build) Your Experience {#share-and-build-your-experience}

Apart from answering questions and sharing resources in the forum and chat, there are a few other less obvious ways to share and expand what you know:

- **Develop learning materials.** It's often said that the best way to learn is to teach. If there's something interesting you're doing with Multipass, strengthen your expertise by writing a blog post, developing a workshop, or even publishing a screenshot of _how you use Multipass_ that you share on social media. Keep in mind to hide any sensitive information.
- **Watch the public repo.** This will send you notifications whenever there's activity in that repository, giving you insider knowledge about ongoing discussions and upcoming features. It's a fantastic way to build expertise so that you're eventually able to help address issues.

### Translate Docs {#translate-docs}

I hope that right now, you're reading this sentence in your preferred language. If not, would you like to help us get there? If so, for now send [Veerle](mailto:veerle@daktadeo.be) a note that you would like to help.

[//]: # (See the [Translations guide]&#40;/translations/&#41; for more details on how you can get involved.)

### Become an Multipass Expert {#become-a-multipass-expert}

Multipass experts are people who have shown a deep commitment to the Multipass Team. They help the project grow, engage with the community, help with documentation, triage issues, and provide support to other users. Experts are granted access to private channels where they can collaborate with other experts and the Core Multipass team.

Experts are allowed to sell Multipass along their own products and services and are essential to the growth of the Multipass ecosystem.

If you're interested in becoming an expert, send [Veerle](mailto:veerle@daktadeo.be) a note. 

[//]: # (There's a lot you can do to help Multipass grow and build &#40;y&#41;our community:)

[//]: # (- **Present at your local meetup.** Whether it's giving a talk or running a workshop, you can bring a lot of value to your community by helping both new and experienced Multipass developers continue to grow.)

[//]: # (- **Start your own meetup.** If there's not already a Vue meetup in your area, you can start your own! Use the [resources at events.vuejs.org]&#40;https://events.vuejs.org/resources/#getting-started&#41; to help you succeed!)

[//]: # (- **Help meetup organizers.** There can never be too much help when it comes to running an event, so offer a hand to help out local organizers to help make every event a success.)
