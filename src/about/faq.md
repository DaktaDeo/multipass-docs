## Who maintains Multipass? {#who-maintains-Multipass}

The idea of building something like Multipass started in 2011. In that year [Veerle Deschepper](https://gompje.be) made a very first version as a personal side project. That version failed. Later in 2014 a new version was born. Today, Multipass is actively maintained by [a team of both full-time and volunteer members from all around the world](/about/team), where Veerle serves as the project lead, and lead Full Stack Developer.

Multipass's development is primarily privately funded by DaktaDeo & friends.

## What license does Multipass use? {#what-license-does-Multipass-use}

Due to limited resources of our dev-team we recommend Vivaldi, Brave or Google Chrome. These are the browsers we use to develop/test the app and are therefore guaranteed to work best.

Multipass slowly growing into a mature and battle-tested app. 

Multipass is used in production in varying capacities all around the world, including DaktaDeo, Brugge Marine Center NV, HT-Legends Gent, Hero on Socks, Silence At Work, Burkinafaso Project, Howest,  and many more.

## Is Multipass fast? {#is-Multipass-fast}

At this time Multipass uses Vue2.0 for the UX interface. We are working on a new version of Multipass that will be based on Vue3.0. This new version will be even faster and more reliable.

We use our own VPS servers and constantly monitor the performance of our servers.

As nomad workers ourselvers, we know how important it is to have a fast and reliable app that works on slower networks. That's why we ourselves regularly test the performance of our app on 4g networks. 

## Does Multipass Work on Mobile? {#does-Multipass-work-on-mobile}
During the beta **our main focus is having a fully working app on desktop**. We do however ‚ù§ our iPhone, and hate not being able to access/add info on the road! üå≤

You can count on it that, **at the very least the most essential features things will work on an iphone SE 2020**. Like seeing contact info or calling them directly from the list. Sometimes with a bit of compromises like using landscape mode or manual clicking on 'hide' for the sidebar.

:::warning Limitations during the Beta period
Cutoff device is an 11-inch iPad pro 202 (M1); using Brave iOS. Used in Landscape mode. Basic feature set & usable with sometimes UI work-arounds.
